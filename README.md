## Notice:
This module is no longer being updated as it has reached it's most stable build.

## Announcement:
I plan to make a new version of this module but only for arm64-v8a devices, this means the new version will have more features, but will not work on armeabi-v7a devices due to utilizing tweaks for arm64 devices that would bootloop on non-arm64 devices.
